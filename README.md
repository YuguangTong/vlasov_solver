# A Linear solver for Maxwell-Vlasov equations

I wrote this python code in 2014 or so and have been updating and using it till now. 

The main source code is in `vlasov_solver/`

The `Makefile` provides some commands to run short and long unit tests. 

The required libraries are `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` and `pandas`. I have tested on Python 3.5+. Behaviors in other versions of interpreter is unknown to me.

`examples/` directory contains some jupyter notebooks that I used for myself. You would need to install `jupyter notebook` to use run them.
